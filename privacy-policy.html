                    If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided Personal Information to

                    we would be the data processor.</p>

                <p>Our role may also differ depending on the specific situation involving Personal Information. We act
                    in the capacity of a data controller when we ask you to submit your Personal Information that is
                    necessary to ensure your access and use of the Website and Services. In such instances, we are a
                    data controller because we determine the purposes and means of the processing of Personal

                <p>We act in the capacity of a data processor in situations when you submit Personal Information through

                    In such instances, the User providing Personal Information acts as a data controller.</p>

                <p>In order to make the Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we may
                    need to collect and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we

                    – Respond to legal requests and prevent harm <br>
                    – Run and operate the Website and Services</p>

                <p>Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Website and Services, where
                    you are located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent
                    for one or more specific purposes; (ii) provision of information is necessary for the performance of
                    an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii) processing is
                    necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is
                    related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
                    authority vested in us; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests
                    pursued by us or by a third party. We may also combine or aggregate some of your Personal
                    Information in order to better serve you and to improve and update our Website and Services.</p>

                <p> Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such
                    processing by opting out, without having to rely on consent or any other of the legal bases. In any
                    case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in
                    particular whether the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement,
                    or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>

                    with strict vulnerability standards in order to create as secure of an environment as possible for

                    purposes of processing your payments, refunding such payments, and dealing with complaints and
                    queries related to such payments and refunds.</p>

                <p>Please note that the Payment Processors may collect some Personal Information from you, which allows

                    account number) and handle all the steps in the payment process through their systems, including
                    data collection and data processing. The Payment Processors’ use of your Personal Information is
                    governed by their respective privacy policies which may or may not contain privacy protections as
                    protective as this Policy. We suggest that you review their respective privacy policies.</p>
